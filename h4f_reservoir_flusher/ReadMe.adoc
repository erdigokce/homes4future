= Project: Toilet Reservoir Flusher

This project is aimed to transform a conventional embedded reservoir flusher (with triggering button) to a more smart, hands-free, arduino based, low powered flusher system.
In this codebase you will find the source code of the main program and the schematics of the system.

== Step 1: Installation
This section covers compiling code and load into Arduino.

1. Clone or download as zip this project to your local (See https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository[here] how to clone a project in GitHub).
2. Open the h4f_reservoir_flusher.ino file with the https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software[Arduino IDE].
3. Adjust the delay/waiting timings if needed. They are defined as https://www.cprogramming.com/reference/preprocessor/define.html[preprocessor directives].
4. Compile and load the code to your board (See https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/howto[here] how to do it.).

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the diagram h4f_reservoir_flusher.fzz attached to the sketch.

== Step 3: Specifications of the device

* 5V working voltage.
* 9.3 mA in deep sleep mode.
* 58 mA in IDLE mode.
* More than 500 mA current is drawn when servo moving.
* For servo (Tower Pro MG955) specifications please click https://www.electronicoscaldas.com/datasheet/MG995_Tower-Pro.pdf[here].
